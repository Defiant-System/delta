### How to
Delta is an uncompromising, crazy, fast paced bullet hell, endless boss battle space shoot'em'up. With focus on gameplay and replayability - and it just feels fun to play. It follows the formula "__easy to learn, hard to master__" and it's always quite a reward to beat your own, previous high score. Each time you defeat a boss, the next one will come back even bigger and meaner.
